      Lately I’ve been musing on alot of things. I'm consciously trying to avoid
      the words 'struggling with’ because these things make me realize areas I
      need to grow in. One big thing on my mind is staying true and grounded to
      my faith. As I grow older, I’ve realized that I had been taking a lot of
      important things for granted, and I’ve been working on being the grown
      adult I want myself to be, by being intentional about my financial,
      career, education, and life after-35 goals. These seem to be taking shape,
      but I’m struggling with actually staying grounded to my faith goals. I am
      on the lukewarm side and I detest it.
      <br />
      <br />
      When I was 15 or 16, someone (who I still can’t remember no matter how
      hard I try) once told me, as you grow older, it becomes even harder than
      you think to create time to grow within your faith. And I never showed it,
      but deep down I scoffed—a gentle scoff, of course. Because when I was
      young, things like praying, casual conversing with God, and even jisting
      were effortless. It felt like an ordinary thing, and I had thought surely
      the relationship will grow and become better as time passed. But now, as I
      sit and think of how I long for those days, I know that person was right.
      <br />
      <br />I still try to create time for God, but there’s that spiritual
      connection that is missing, and I know why it’s missing because it was
      never about the conversations or the prayers; it was about the habits that
      kept Him close. I realized that in the past, there were no distracting
      habits, just struggling to get that perfect grade, laughing and having
      good conversations with friends, looking forward to a good meal, and that
      was it. Nothing ever crossed me to the level of losing my temper and
      crying out angrily. The only thing that could cross me was when my
      housemate decided to throw my wet clothes to the floor because she wanted
      to hang hers. But that’s easily dismissable, right? It’s not that deep.
      And at night when I slept, I would talk to God about it and say to please
      forgive her, and it never burdened me. But right now, having such a
      scenario happen to me might through me into a mental spiral. Point is,
      there are more things that are now proving hard to navigate and with more
      of this I feel farthest from His presence. To keep my sanity, I’ve taken
      some time away from Our jisting, casual conversations (maybe I’m
      delusional but yes they were conversations) to help me deal with the
      constant trials.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the past, the gentle inner voice which I had come to recognize
      distinctively, would guide me through every emotion, every action. But
      somehow, that connection has slipped away. I pray to revive it, and I know
      the how-to, but it's not happening. I fully know it is in the habits I’ve
      picked up gradually that are pushing Him away. But those very habits are
      my coping mechanisms. So, the question is—how do I learn to let them go?
